        <h2>Strongest Trait and Emotion</h2>
        <p>One of my strongest traits is <strong>determination</strong>, paired with the emotion of <strong>curiosity</strong>. These qualities fuel my drive to excel academically and dive deeper into my passions, such as game development, AI, and environmental sustainability. My determination pushes me to overcome obstacles, whether it’s learning a new programming language or working on complex environmental projects. Curiosity keeps me exploring new areas, allowing me to constantly improve my technical and creative skills. This combination helps me stay focused and committed to my studies, always pushing myself to achieve more.</p>

        <h2>Hobby Impact</h2>
        <p>My hobby of <strong>game development</strong> has a profound impact on my academic life. It allows me to apply what I learn in class to real-world projects, enhancing my problem-solving skills and creativity. Designing interactive games has taught me how to think critically, organize my ideas, and manage time effectively, all of which are crucial to my success in school.</p>

        <h2>Favourite Quote and Hero</h2>
        <blockquote>"If your dreams do not scare you, they are not big enough." – Ellen Johnson Sirleaf</blockquote>
        <p>This quote resonates with me because I believe that growth happens when you step out of your comfort zone and pursue ambitious goals.</p>
        <p>My hero is <strong>Ellen Johnson Sirleaf</strong>, the former president of Liberia and Africa’s first elected female head of state. Sirleaf's courage in the face of adversity and her efforts to rebuild Liberia after years of civil war are truly inspiring. Despite numerous challenges, she remained resilient and committed to her vision for her country’s future. I admire her leadership, bravery, and her passion for education and equality. Her legacy motivates me to persevere through challenges, work hard, and aim to make a positive impact on both my community and the world, especially in the fields of technology and sustainability.</p>

        <h2>Personality Assessment and Interests</h2>
        <p>I completed a personality assessment using the <strong>Keirsey Temperament Sorter</strong> on <a href="http://similarminds.com/" target="_blank">Similarminds</a>. My results indicated that I am a <strong>Rational (INTP)</strong>, which is often characterized by a strong analytical mindset, curiosity, and a preference for independent problem-solving. The test suggests that I am driven by a desire to understand complex concepts and innovate, traits that align with my passion for technology, AI development, and environmental solutions.</p>
        
        <p>Reflecting on the test, I find it has a degree of validity. The results accurately captured my tendency to prioritize logic and creativity in my decision-making process. While personality tests have limitations, I felt that this assessment resonated with me, particularly in highlighting my analytical nature and inclination towards intellectual exploration.</p>
